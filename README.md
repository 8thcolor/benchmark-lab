# Benchmark Experiment

Run Real Experiment and Calculate Non-Parametric Statistics.

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install benchmark-experiment

## Usage

TODO

## Ideas

* compare two different implementations of a same function
  1. get the stats, then compare
  2. use git (commit, branch)
  3. use tests to check no performance regression at the same time
  4. annotate the tests you want to check
* decide the sample size automatically (based on the power you want to reach)
* explain correctly why we should do that
